-> The use of integer arithmetic, especially with division and the sqrt function (which performs integer square root), inevitably leads to precision loss. This could result in slight inaccuracies in calculated token amounts or reserve releases, potentially accumulating over time or being exploited in edge cases.

-> While basic arithmetic is checked, complex intermediate calculations involving squares (e.g., a_scaled * a_scaled, new_r_scaled * new_r_scaled) could potentially exceed uint256's maximum value if inputs (r, a, b) are extremely large, even after initial scaling down. This would cause reverts.
